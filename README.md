# My Work

Oh, howdy there! 
Glad you made it here.
In this little corner of the internet, I host some the projects I have worked on or are currently working on.
Feel free to contact me for any question using form found at the bottom of my [website](https://oescoba2.github.io.).
I give a breakdown of each directory in this repo and the contents therein in a TL;DR format.
I also have pictures of some of the major projects in each directory.

# About Me
I am Oscar J. Escobar and are about to finish the Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACME) degree at Brigham Young University (BYU) this December.
I love football (i.e. soccer) and am a huge fan of Real Madrid.
In my spare time, I like to cook, watch series and movies, play the piano and guitar, and learn new things.


# Modeling_data 
This directory contains some of the projects I have undertaken where I applied ML, Time Series, or deep learning in order to model with data and uncertainty.

# OTC_Dyanmics
This directory contains some of the projects where I modeled using dynamics and then applied optimal control theory (OTC).

# DRL
This directory contains my work in implementing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in order to learn and apply it.
I am happy to say I authored about 85% of the RL labs in ACME.

# DA
This directory contains the work for the data assimilation projects I have worked with.

# Coursework
This directory contains some of the cool homeworks or labs I did as part of the classes I took at BYU.

* HW4_1.py: this were several problems where I applied dynamic programming principles to do my homework.
* HW4_5.py: This algorithm was intended to solve a {0,1} (that is either you take one or zero of an item) knapsack problem of n-items with given weights (w1,...,wn) and values (v1,...,vn)
* binary_trees.py: I very much enjoyed this lab. The lab was intended to help me learn to code a BST tree using some recursive techniques for searching and inserting nodes. It also helped me learn the difference in time complexities of BST vs. AVL vs. Singly Linked Lists. This one tested more of my knowledge about programming thus far as well as comprehension of recursion. I received a 50/50
